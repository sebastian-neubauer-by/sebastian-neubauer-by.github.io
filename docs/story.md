# The Story

## The Products

In our Blue Yonder products portfolio we have two products that are tightly
coupled to one each other. It is Luminate Demand Edge (LDE), our demand forecasting solution for Retail
and Luminate Store Fulfilment (LSF), our solution to automated and optimized orders based on demand predictions. 
LSF takes the demand predictions of LSF and turns them into order proposals using sophisticated algorithms. 
In LDE, the customer is able to override the demand predictions generated by LDE and LSF would pickup those overridden
demand predicitons automatically.

## The Override Prediction Incident

James is a supply chain specialist working at one of Blue yonder's customer, a grocery store and is responsible 
for the LSF product.
Today, James has a very bad day, all shelves are empty in one of the stores. That's not good. But happened?
It turns out, there is a big festival happeing next to this store. It turns out, Susan, a demand specialist working 
at the same customer but responsible for the demand predictions of LDE product indeed adjusted the demands using 
predictions overrides. But why were the orders not adjusted as well?
LSF typically run at fixed daily schedules and if the prediction overrides are created after the LSF run already 
processed for the day, the predictions overrides will only be picked up at the next run which in this case was too late.

James, who has some basic knowledge of programming, decides to use the extensibility features of the Luminate 
Platform and build a notification mechanism. This will help him to prevent any of these kind of incidents in the future.

Let's help James and build this feature together with him!
